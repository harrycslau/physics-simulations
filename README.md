# Physics Simulations

A collection of interactive physics simulations for education, created by a group of physics teachers.

## Structure

The simulations are organized by topic:

*   **Heat and Gases**
*   **Optics and Wave Motion**
*   **Force and Motion**
*   **Electricity and Magnetism**
*   **Nuclear Physics**
*   **Biology**

## Usage

Here is our production website:
https://harrycslau.github.io/physics-simulations/

If you pull the repo and want to test it, 
you can do so by running `python3 -m http.server` in the root folder,
then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000.
